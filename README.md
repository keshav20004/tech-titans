# Tech Titans

Tech Titans helps **local small shops** build their online presence by creating **simple, clean, and affordable websites**.  
Our mission is to make every local business visible, searchable, and reachable — without tech headaches.

## 🚀 What We Do

Most neighborhood shops are offline-only:
- No website
- Hard to find online
- Lose customers to competitors with digital presence

**Tech Titans fixes this.**  
We create **mobile-first websites** that make shops easy to discover and contact.
